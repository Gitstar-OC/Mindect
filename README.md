# Mindect 

- Mindect are docs for everyone who wants to learn about AI, ML, Supervised Learning and Advanced Learning ALgorithms. 

- Other notes about Deep learning, unsupervised learning and large language models is in progress and Mindect is continuosly under developemnt.


### Hope you find this notes useful for you, this learning platform also consists of image, codeblocks and downloadable jupyter notebooks to help you understand concepts at a deeper level. Give it a star if you like it. It really helps me add new content. 

<!-- 
- start a blog where various data scientist, analyst and teachers could colaborate on writing.
- at first can use static pages as it will not require any database, later small database could be used. 


In the future, change the homepage. 
## Issues and Features. 
- not getting images after downloading notebook, package should be downloaded as zip, with image and the notebook
- add scroll to top button and border in between of footer and toc
- make navbar theme to black ( just one theme for the navbar on the homepage)
// Currently the animation is being removed if added fix the things 
- Add background animation for the intro  (same as qu.ai) and the pagedown effect of (grili)
- Loader just for one time or no loader
- remove the theme changer for the main page

  We're working on a total rewrite of Briefkasten and plan on releasing this
  `v2` soon. If you want to follow along, get alerted to any updates, or submit
  some feature requests or complaints, please check out this [GitHub Discussion
  thread](https://github.com/ndom91/briefkasten/discussions/65).

The below docs are in preparation for that. If you're looking for the v1 docs, check out the [v1 Docs](https://v1.docs.briefkastenhq.com) link in the nav bar.

**Once v2 is stable, we will wipe the temporary development database active
there now and migrate all data from the current v1 to v2**
