# Mindect

![Mindect Image](./public/Banner.png)

- Mindect are docs for everyone who wants to learn about AI, ML, Supervised Learning and Advanced Learning ALgorithms.
<!--
- use media query for special navigation bar so that it only appears on pc and not on mobile or tablet
- add backlins for pages to make the pages go on top with search engines named additioanl resourses, read more at etc.
- add all the exports in the lib file
- add cn in the components that you have made so it will take the styling
- contribute to navbar to make it visible via props
- show remaining topics when hovered
- fix the seo of mindect, use generate metadata from nextjs
- shorten the path of @/components/ui to @cui
- add icon for index.mdx, what is machine learning and jupyter notebook
- add a slider instead of radio button along with a box that shows the font size from 1 to 10
<<<<<<< HEAD
- add main file for all 3 mathematics files.
- fix the seo of mindect.
- create an option to run the code like the web3 school has to run and customize it using the persons own machine resources and ram. Can be done using C, python, C+.
- add complete code for jupyter notebook below the file so the user can download and run it. 
- give option to select what to learn on the mainpage mathematics, deep learning or machine learning.
- add the hover effect to items in navbar like the one vercel has use this for additional info and configuration https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs/discussions/936
- add images in algebra readme
- update scroller for math functions and formulas

## Starting the development server

1. Clone the repository and move to the repo using `cd mindect`
2. Install all the related dependencies using `npm install` and `npm run dev` to run the development server

For contributing make sure you have read the [Contributing Guidelines](./.github/contributing.md) file

<!--
- arrange pages properly like the neural network model is showing neural network layer, you have to fix it.

- start a blog where various data scientist, analyst and teachers could colaborate on writing.
- at first can use static pages as it will not require any database, later small database could be used.


In the future, change the homepage.
## Issues and Features.
- not getting images after downloading notebook, package should be downloaded as zip, with image and the notebook
- add scroll to top button and border in between of footer and toc
- make navbar theme to black ( just one theme for the navbar on the homepage)
// Currently the animation is being removed if added fix the things
- Add background animation for the intro  (same as qu.ai) and the pagedown effect of (grili)
- Loader just for one time or no loader
- remove the theme changer for the main page

Things remaining in completed part
- Adding jupyter notebook in visualization examples (regression model).

  We're working on a total rewrite of Briefkasten and plan on releasing this
  `v2` soon. If you want to follow along, get alerted to any updates, or submit
  some feature requests or complaints, please check out this [GitHub Discussion
  thread](https://github.com/ndom91/briefkasten/discussions/65).

The below docs are in preparation for that. If you're looking for the v1 docs, check out the [v1 Docs](https://v1.docs.briefkastenhq.com) link in the nav bar.

**Once v2 is stable, we will wipe the temporary development database active
there now and migrate all data from the current v1 to v2**
